            Piero is the founder, owner and CEO of Peopleâ€™s Wealth. He started
            this company to change the financial industry in the United States
            after watching borrowers fall victim to the sharks in a murky
            financial industry. In his spare time, Piero has a passion for the
            level of intensity and concentration that a gym session can bring.
            Recently, he has been looking to get into golf and hoping to develop
            a perfect swing.
